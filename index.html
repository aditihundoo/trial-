        <b><i>Social media</i></b> has become an integral part of teenagers' lives. With constant access to information and connection, platforms like Instagram and TikTok offer endless possibilities for entertainment, education, and social interaction.
        Social media can be a good thing, but if  teens ever feel uncomfortable about something they see or read on social, they should trust their own feelings and talk to someone like a parent, a teacher, or another trusted adult.<br> 
        Bullying, threats and cruelty on social media are all signs that the person doing those things needs help.<br>

        Social media has irrevocably transformed the way we communicate, consume information, and interact with the world. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, offering unparalleled connectivity and access to a global community. 
        Through these digital avenues, we can connect with friends and family across vast distances, share experiences, and foster a sense of belonging. Moreover, social media has emerged as a powerful tool for activism, enabling individuals to raise awareness about social issues and drive change. However, this digital landscape is not without its challenges. 
        The constant pressure to curate a perfect online image can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. The spread of misinformation and the potential for cyberbullying pose significant threats to individual well-being and societal harmony. 
        As we navigate this complex terrain, it is imperative to harness the benefits of social media while critically evaluating its impact and adopting responsible practices.
